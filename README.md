# Difference-in-int-Arrays

After user enters the first array elements and the second array elements separated by space,
calculates the difference between two int[] arrays, say array a and array b, i.e: a-b
and returns the result as another int[] array.

For example if user enters
1 2 2
as elements of the first array
and enters
1
as element of second array,
then [1,2,2] - [1]
is calculated so
[2,2]
will be printed out as a result.
